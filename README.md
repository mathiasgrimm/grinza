Experimental custom PHP Framework for studying modern object oriented concepts like S.O.L.I.D, clean code, etc

Making the code super convenient and easy to use is not the scope of this project at least for now.
Adding such flexibility adds much more need for different tests and cases and decision points. 
For example, the `Route` accepts only array as the argument for the httpMethods. For convenience we could also accept strings but that
introduces some ifs, tests etc...

# Minimal requirements
This projects requires at least PHP 7.1
